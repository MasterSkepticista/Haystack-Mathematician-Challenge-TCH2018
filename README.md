Implemented on: MATLAB
1. The script/program initially captures the image from a webcam (IP/NON-IP both codes attached) and pre-processes the image, by applying median noise filters.
2. Program then 'segregates' the image in RGB to individual planes. (This heavily affects identification of yellow/light color straws because the fundamental process of rgb2gray doesn't capture those)
3. After applying edge detection with parameterized 'fudge factor', the script creates 2 'structuring elements' for the 'dilator'.
4. Image edges are smoothened by dilation with the structuring elements created above.
5. All the RGB planes are evaluated separately and then 'combined' to avoid any information that is lost.
6. Image is binarized.
7. Circles are counted using Phase Code method (Two Stage is more prone to noise) and Hough Transform.
This results in a 90-95% accuracy for a bundle of 60-70 straws, and upto 100% for 40 straws.

Proposed solution for best-in-class accuracy:
Implementer: Convolutional Neural Network
1. The script would require training a CNN for edge detection. But since it is not feasible to 'create' the huge dataset it requires, in such a time, it could not be prototyped to submit before 8th March.
2. The CNN trained would generate excellent edge detected output, and can be directly used to count circles.

The only problem with standalone filters is that they are 'blind'. They don't see the image, but are plain Mathematical transforms. CNNs when implemented, can identify the required regions of interests.
